# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 06, Saturday
 
**Today's Progress**: as kick start picked up Wes Bos's javascript30 course.

**Thoughts:**

* I didn't know `<kbd></kbd>` is a tag in HTML. It's used to define keyboard inputs. The tag is used when it is needed to display text that the user should enter into their keyboard (for any number of reasons).

* `transform` in css used for `transform: scale(1.1);` inside a class scales up whatever in the class by 10% present. 
* `transitionend` is an event you can use to listen to an end of a transition. 

* backtics and template syntax are great way contact strings in javascript.
   ``const key = document.querySelector(`div[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);``

* you can add add `EventListners` to html page by, 
  `window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound);`

### Day 2: April 07, Sunday
 
**Today's Progress**: created internet speed widget using tailwind css and Network information API.

**Thoughts**:

* Tailwind css is a utility based css framework. It is an excellent framework. very straightforward to create components using that.

* network information API is a way to get the internet speed from the browser only.

* combining those two I created the widget that shows the internet speed.

### Day 3: April 08, Monday
 
**Today's Progress**: finished the second excise of wesbos's javascript30 course. I created a css javascript clock. 

**Thoughts**:

* I have been a front-end developer for a while now, but since today I haven't used 2D Transforms directly. It was
a pleasant experience to use them. 

**Useful link(s)**:
   [2D transforms](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp)

**Today's Progress**: release a new version of gatsby web site astronomers.lk. Update the content of the website. Change the duration
of the [react slick carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) at the top of the page.
